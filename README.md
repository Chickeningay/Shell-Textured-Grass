Shell Textured Grass Shader Graph<br />
Thanks to Acerola on youtube for inspiration<br />
Used Shadergraphs since i'd rather die than to learn real shaders ðŸ˜€<br />
Didnt annotate shit since no one will see this anyway<br />
u can play around with the material properties to get cool effects like mountains n cool vfx lookin stuff or just plain ol' grass
