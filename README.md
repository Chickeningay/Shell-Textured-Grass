Shell Textured Grass Shader Graph
Thanks to Acerola on youtube for inspiration
Used Shadergraphs since i'd rather die than to learn real shaders ðŸ˜€
Didnt annotate shit since no one will see this anyway
u can play around with the material properties to get cool effects like mountains n cool vfx lookin stuff or just plain ol' grass
